# Coming Soon!

In consideration:
- Separate interface (page) for merchant and customer. Referring to ASP.NET, where you can set the appropriate element visible/invisible based on the authorization level of a end-user, which therefore only results in one page in ASP.NET.

In progress:
- Merchant dashboard interface

What's coming:
- Ability for merchants to list their product
- Ability for merchants to add a picture of their product
- Ability for merchants to add their product into a Group of products, which represents their "variant".
- Ability for merchants to classify what "tag" do their product belongs to.
